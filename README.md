└── test/                   # Automated tests
```

## Architectural Details

### State Management
The app uses **Riverpod** for state management, with providers organized by feature:
- `GameProviders`: Manages the game state, dialogue, and scenes
- `DatabaseProviders`: Handles database access and game progress
- `SettingsProviders`: Manages user preferences
- `ThemeProviders`: Controls app theme settings

### Database
The app uses **Drift** (formerly Moor) for local SQLite database functionality:
- Character data
- Save games
- Player progress (vocabulary, grammar, cultural notes)
- Relationship tracking

### Navigation
**GoRouter** is used for navigation between screens, with route definitions in `app_router.dart`.

## Game Content Structure

Game content is structured in JSON files:
- **Chapters**: Contain metadata and scene lists
- **Scenes**: Collections of dialogue nodes and choices
- **Dialogue**: Individual lines with associated data (speaker, text, etc.)
- **Choices**: Player options with consequences

Example script structure:
```json
{
  "id": "scene_1",
  "title": "First Day",
  "nodes": {
    "node_1": {
      "line": {
        "id": "line_1",
        "characterId": "1",
        "textJp": "こんにちは！",
        "textEn": "Hello!",
        "nextId": "line_2",
        "tags": ["vocab:1", "grammar:2"]
      }
    }
  },
  "startNodeId": "node_1"
}
```
